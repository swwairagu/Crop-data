# Cotton Data
## Abstract

Plant-derived biostimulants, such as iQFORTE, have gained popularity due to their potential to enhance plant growth, yield, and quality while minimizing the need for fertilizers and preserving the environment. This research aims to investigate the impact of iQFORTE on cotton, an agriculturally important crop in North Carolina, by exploring and analyzing data collected from 20 treated plants and 20 control plants. The data were collected by a researcher from the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences at North Carolina State University, with response variables of interest including the number of open bolls per plant, open boll weight, seed weight, and lint weight. As the sample size for each group is 20, normality cannot be assumed based on the Central Limit Theorem. Therefore, normality is first assessed through the Shapiro-Wilk test, and based on the result, a t-test or a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test is conducted to evaluate the effect of the biostimulant on cotton. The study intends to enhance the understanding of nonparametric statistical tests like the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and provide recommendations to the researchers at NCSU for analyzing crop data with small sample sizes and non-normally distributed outcomes.
